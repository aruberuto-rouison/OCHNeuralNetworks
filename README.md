"A new mathematical model for brain memory working. Optimal control behavior for Hopfield networks"
by Franco Cardin, Alberto Lovison, Amos Maritan, Aram
Megighian. The paper is available at:

The software simulates the behavior of a small neural network evolving under an optimal control process and implementing 
functions of recognition of patterns, learning, forgetting. Chaotic, non convergent behavior are also encompassed by the model.
